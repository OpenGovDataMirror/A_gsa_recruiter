# recruiter [WIP]
Embeddable forms for recruiting usability research participants. Uses Google Tag Manager to load form UI and targeting, and a custom Google Apps Script to send submissions to a Google Sheet.

## Components

![feedback platform components](/docs/img/Feedback_Platform_Components-v2.svg)


 - [Google Sheets Template](https://docs.google.com/a/gsa.gov/spreadsheets/d/1_de-8lkbxPAy0ovb_WH22EI03vX8ZnuZhhiXnXWvxpQ/copy)
 - [Google Tag Manager](https://tagmanager.google.com) - account required
 - [U.S. Web Design System](https://standards.usa.gov/) styles and [form patterns guidance](https://standards.usa.gov/components/form-templates/) for accessibility.

 **Optional**
 - Integration with Google Analytics to send custom events when a user opens, closes, and submits the Recruiter form dialog.


## Deploying
See [Wiki](https://github.com/GSA/recruiter/wiki/Deploying)

## Default fields provided in this configuration:

 | Field name | Type | Description |
 | ---------- | ---- | ----------- |
 | Date | Timestamp | submission time and date |
 | Name | String | First name |
 | Email | String | Email address |
 | UserAgent | String | OS + Version, Browser + version |
 | URL* | String | URI of page where form was submitted |
 | Referrer* | String | Referring page (how user arrived at PageURL |

**\*Note:** When deploying to sites where URLs contain references to content that may infer information of a personal or sensitive nature (e.g. visiting content related to medical conditions on NIH.gov), you may wish to omit passing the last two fields (`URL` and `Referrer`) to the Sheet. This can be done simply by removing the last two query parameters (`&Referrer={{Referrer}}&URL={{Page URL}}`) from the URL in the `Recruiter to Google Sheet` Custom Image Tag in GTM.

 **Warning: PIA, [PRA](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/guidance/pra-overview.html) or other privacy or security compliance issues may be triggered for any customized capture fields. Consult your agency's Chief Privacy Officer and/or PRA Desk Officer before deploying any customized form versions.**
